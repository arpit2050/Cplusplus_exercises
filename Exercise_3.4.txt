//Exercise 3.4 to check words are equal or not and report which one has greater length

// Example program
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;
int main()
{
string word1,word2;
cout<<"Enter first word"<<endl;
cin>>word1;
cout<<"Enter second word"<<endl;
cin>>word2;
if(word1==word2)
{
}
else
{
    if(word1.size()>word2.size())
    {
        cout<<word1<<" is greater in size than "<<word2;
    }
    else
    {
        cout<<word2<<" is greater in size than "<<word1;
    }
}
return 0;
}

// exercise 3.4  this time program checks whether length are same or not 
// Example program
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;
int main()
{
string word1,word2;
cout<<"Enter first word"<<endl;
cin>>word1;

    }
}
else
